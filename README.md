NFT infrastructure that allows Creators/Investor to register their Intelectual Property (IP) as an NFT. The platform then allows other users to Rent the IP for a certain duration to use for their own purposes rewarding the Creators/Investors.

NFT staking, value transfer and reward collection implementation. Every time an NFT is rented, minted or re-sold there is an inflow to the staker's pool where they can they harvest their respective rewards.
