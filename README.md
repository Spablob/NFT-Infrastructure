NFT infrastructure that allows NFT minting, renting and buying/selling via NFT Marketplace. Includes NFT staking (ERC1155), value transfer and reward collection implementation. 

Every time an NFT is minted, rented or re-sold there is an inflow to the staker's pool where they can they harvest their respective rewards.
